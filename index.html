              Web development is the ultimate tool to ensure humanity's
              expression of itself. Humanity has created these tools from
              houndreds and houndreds of years of logical development until we
              had the opportunity to create a digital space inside a computer.
              Computer science, is the fundamental way for humanity to surpass
              itself. By creating these incredible <em>spaces</em>, we are
              creating an opportunity for us to be remembered as how we want to
              be. A part of our souls made technology.
